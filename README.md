These can be programmed using TinyGo.

There are some Grove sensor kits that you can use for the activity.

Ready to try this out? Go to [./sensor/arduino/](./sensor/arduino/) to get started.

### TinyGo Music Jam

Make your own electronic musical instruments using TinyGo and the Raspberry Pi Nano boards.

Thanks to the USB-MIDI support, you can turn your board into a tiny digital musical instrument controller.

Add buttons, sliders, a joystick, and when we say become part of the music we mean it!

Let's make beautiful music together, just go to [./musicjam/](./musicjam/).
